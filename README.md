Cultivation: Each yield is assigned a global identifier. This identifier states and archives all additives and employee interactions to ensure accountability and adhere to federal regulations.

Harvest: All cannabis components are batched by material-type. Batched material receives a new identifier that contains plant history since growth. 

Testing: Tested for chemicals, contaminants, and other harmful additives prior to entering the marketplace. Test results, including potency, are automatically assigned and printed on product labels.

Transportation: A detailed manifest must be completed prior to transportation. The manifest will display shipments’ origin, a detailed contents list including quantity, destination and driver credentials, displaying the entire chain of custody. Made available for law enforcement in real-time.

Point-of-Sale: In addition to linking products to producers, all transaction made within the marketplace are tracked to the participants or consumer. 

Real-Time Data Portal: We will maintain a secure, online, data hub that provides detailed analytics for regulatory agencies and law enforcement. The data will allow law enforcement agencies to track cannabis transportation and inventory in real-time. This ensures compliance and adherence to industry standards and state laws.
